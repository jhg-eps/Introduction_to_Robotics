Compile the example with the command
# make

Run the executable with
# ./example

When working on a future labs it's recommended to start with a new set of source files
To do this navigate to the lab directory (you'll see example from this directory) and type
# cp -r example lab1

A new directory called lab1 should appear that is an exact copy of your previous lab. Have at it.
